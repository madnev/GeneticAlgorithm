# GeneticAlgorithm

This project was part of my thesis "Data Science Methods in Chemical Product Development" for MSc in Business Analytics from Nova School of Business and Economics.
In this project, I studied the use case of Genetic Function Approximation for feature selection in chemical product design. Specifically, how it can help chemists understand intercations between different components and navigate high-dimensional spaces.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation was used for the fitness function instead of Ordinary Least Squares, to account for censored data.

For confidentiality purposes, the Exploratory Data Analysis was omitted from this repository and the data anonymized.
